# App FAQ
#### Introduction
With App FAQs, you can set your app FAQs in LAS Console with different languages and display them in your app. If the problem your users just encountered canâ€™t be found in your FAQs, they can submit their questions using the Contact Us option in that interface.

#### Create App faqs
You can choose the Language you want to add in App FAQs page. We provide you with the three default FAQ Sections, General, Billing and Privacy, in English, Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, Japanese and French among all languages. Each FAQ Section contains the questions of the same kind. For example, you can put some simple questions into general, the payment issues in billing and privacy terms in Privacy. If you prefer, you can create your own FAQ Section and delete the three default FAQ Sections for your convenience.

Click on the Plus button on the left FAQ Sections, enter the Section name in the Popup, and a new FAQ Section has been created. After that, you can create your very first FAQ by tapping the +FAQ on the right side of the main interface. After filling the Q and A, you can revise your FAQ by editing rich text, adding images and videos, then press Save. This FAQ will appear in the FAQ Section it belongs to and you can arrange the FAQ by dragging the left side and delete the FAQ by clicking the right side.
